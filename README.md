🚀 Project Overview

This project automates the process of extracting structured company information (like company name, membership number, contact, email, etc.) from 289 scanned images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Python.

The final result is a CSV file (finalt.csv) containing all extracted company details — ready for analysis, integration, or reporting.
